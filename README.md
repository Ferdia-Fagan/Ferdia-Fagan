- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ferdia-Fagan
- 👀 I’m interested in building applications (web, android(i.e. mobile) and desktop) and Systems (mostly server or ambient systems for local desktop or server)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a full-stack/backend web application engineer,
 although I am wanting to focus on backend currently
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects
- 📫 How to reach me: ferdiafagan@gmail.com (but with a subject please :) )

Currently love working with all things Scala, Kotlin, Java, and JVM in general.

Languages:
JVM: Java , Scala, and Kotlin
Backend: Golang, Spring (Java, Kotlin, etc), Ktor (Kotlin)
for browser: HTML, CSS, JS, TS
Frontend Frameworks: Vue, Svelte (React as well, although not well enough, so I would be keeping the docs close by my side)
database: SQL

I dream of being involved in starting a company,
and I really want to find like-minded people 
who want to make something
revolutionary.
