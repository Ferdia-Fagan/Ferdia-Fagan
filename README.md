- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ferdia-Fagan
- 👀 I’m interested in building applications (web, android(i.e. mobile) and desktop)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to be a frontend/backend web application engineer, although I am wanting to focus exclusively on backend currently
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects
- 📫 How to reach me: ferdiafagan@gmail.com (but with a subject please :) )

Currently loving working with all things Scala, and JVM in general.
